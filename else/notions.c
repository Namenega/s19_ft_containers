/*	Red black tree */
/*	https://algorithmtutor.com/Data-Structures/Tree/Red-Black-Trees/ */
/*	[see the link for picture about RBT] */
/*	A RBT is a binary search tree having following five additional properties :
		1. Every node in T is either black or red.
		2. The root node of T is black.
		3. Every NULL node is black. NULL nodes are the leaf nodes.
			They do not contain any keys.
		4. If a node is red, both of its children are black. This means no two
			nodes on a path can be red nodes.
		5. Every path from a root node to a NULL node has the same number of
			black nodes.
	
	Among all dynamics set operations (search, predecessor, successor, insert,
	delete, etc), there are 2 operations that may violate the invariants listed
	above. These are insertion and deletion.
	Therefore, after every insertion/deletion, we check if the operation violated
	any of the properties : if it did, we need to restructure the tree to keep
	the invariants intact. Three tools :
		1. Left_rotate(T, x) : The left rotation at node X makes X goes down in
			the left direction, and as a result, it's right child goes up. [link]
		2. Right_rotate(T, y) : The right rotation at node X makes X goes down
			in the right direction and as a result, its left child goes up. [link]
		3. Recolor : recolor flips the color of a node. If it's red, it becomes
			blac, and vice-versa.
	We call a RBT a balanced search tree because its height is always in the
	order of 0(log n) (Complexity level).

	Insertion : to insert a node K into a red black tree T, we do the following :
		1. Insert K using an ordinary BST insertion operation.
		2. Color K in red
		3. Check if the insertion violated the RBT properties. If yes : fix it.
	Lets suppose about node K in tree T:
	- P = parent node
	- U = uncle node
	- S = sibling node
	- G = grandparent node

	Case 1. T is empty : we make K the root of the tree and color it black.
	Case 2. P is black : it can not violate any of the properties. Therefore, in
			this case, we do not need to do anything.
	Case 3. P is red : This violates property[4]. P and K are now both red. The
			G must be black -> check whether U is red or black.

		3.1 P is red and U is red : flip the color of P, U, G. P becomes black,
			U becomes black and G becomes red (only if it's not the root).
		3.2 P is red and U is black (or NULL) : we need single or double tree
			rotations depending upon whether K is left or right child of P.
			3.2.1 - P is right of G and K is right of P : left rotation at G
				that makes G the new S of K. Next, change the color of S to red
				and P to black.
			3.2.2 - P is right of G and K is left of P : right rotation at P and
				then apply 3.2.1.
			3.2.3 - P is left of G and K is left of P : symetric solution of 3.2.1
			3.2.4 - P is left of G and K is right of P : symetric to 3.2.2

	Deletion : first we follow the ordinary BST deletion process, which makes sure
		that X is either a leaf node or a single child.
	
	Case 1. X is a red node : we simply delete X since deleting a red node doesnt
			violates any property.
	Case 2. X has a red child : we replace X by its red child and change the color
			of the child.
	Case 3. X is a black node : deleting a black node violates propery[5], so we
			add an extra black node to the deleted node and call it a double black
			node. Now we need to convert this double black into a single black.
		3.1 S is red : we switch the color of S and P and perform the left rotation
			on P.
		3.2 S is black and both of S children are black : switch S color to red,
			if P color is red, we change its color to black and this becomes the
			terminal case. Otherwise, we make P a new X and repeat process (?)
		3.3 S is black, S left child is red and right child black : switch color
			of S and left child of S, right rotation on S (it's 3.4 tree) 
		3.4 S is black, S right child is red : switch color of right child to
			black, P to black and left rotation on P
